## Course Description

This is an introductory course on numerical computation with a focus on computer program realization using Julia. The course covers topics such as roots of non-linear equations, function approximation with series expansions, polynomial interpolation and data fitting, algorithms for solving linear systems of equations, quadrature rules for numerical integration, difference rules for numerical differentiation, and a tentative topic on numerical methods for differential equations. Emphasis is made on algorithm development implementation in Julia and the basic mathematical ideas behind the algorithms. Learning to use Julia will be an important part of the course.

## Course Prerequisites

Every method and algorithm taught in this course will be coded in Julia. This course offers guide/tutorials only on specific programming details in Julia, which is not suitable for complete coding beginners.

## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Demonstrate a basic knowledge of programming in Julia.
- Demonstrate a basic knowledge of numerical differentiation/integration, interpolation, and data fitting.
- Be able to implement numerical computation algorithms such as root-finding, expansion, interpolation/data fitting, matrix calculation, and numerical integrations.
